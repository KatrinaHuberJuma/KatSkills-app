It only goes to login 'sometimes'

MH suggestion
	Learned something interesting about angular â€¦ not useful, but interesting,
in your app.js comment out this line:
$httpProvider.interceptors.push('AttachTokens');
and make sure you see a line like this nearby (otherwise add it):
delete $httpProvider.defaults.headers.common['X-Requested-With'];

still get...

services/services.js: Custs.getAll alive
:8081/#/custs:1 XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8080/rest/default/demo/v1/demo:customer. Request header field Access-Control-Allow-Headers is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.
